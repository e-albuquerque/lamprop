The fibers and resin used in this example are taken from M. W. Hyer's
"Stress Analysis of Fiber-Reinforced Materials" pp. 89 & 90. The densities
are estimates.

t: quasi isotropic laminate
This is an attempt to make a laminate the has good extensional and shear
moduli. If you add more layers, and make the angles between the layers
smaller, the laminate will exhibit better quasi isotropic properties.
